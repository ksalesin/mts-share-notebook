Here we present improved values for Stokes parameters published by Coulson, Dave and Sekera 
(1960). These are tabulated for the following sets of parameters:

TAU = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.5, 1
ALBEDO = 0.0, 0.25, 0.8
MU0 = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.92, 1.0
MU = 0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.16, 0.2, 0.28, 0.32, 0.4, 0.52, 0.64, 0.72, 0.84, 0.92, 0.96, 0.98, 1.0
PHI = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180

Here, TAU is the optical thickness; ALBEDO is the ground albedo of an underlying Lambert 
surface; MU0 is the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the incident beam and 
the vertical; MU is the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the emergent beam 
and the vertical; PHI is the relative azimuth angle between the emergent and incident 
beams.

We refer the reader to Natraj et al. (2009) for computational details.

The files are named as follows:

{I/Q/U}_{UP/DN}_TAU_{0.02/0.05/0.1/0.15/0.25/0.5/1}

where the filename has one of each argument inside the parentheses. UP, DN refer, 
respectively, to upwelling radiation emerging from the top of the atmosphere and 
downwelling radiation emerging from the bottom of the atmosphere.
